Java HibernateDemo
==================

This is a very simple and mostly useless application that demonstrates how to integrate Hibernate.

By default the application uses the in-memory HSQLDB. When you start the application you can see
all the SQL commands executed by it and the resulting output which shows that the Entity and it's
child Entity have been successfully persisted in the database.

As this is a Maven project, you should be able to easily import it into your IDE.
