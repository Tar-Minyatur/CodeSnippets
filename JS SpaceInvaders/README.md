JS SpaceInvaders
================

The video game classic "Space Invaders" implemented in JavaScript and rendered
using HTML5's `<canvas>` element. This is purely for experimentation purposes
and not supposed to be a model implementation.

## Features

- All colors are customizeable
- Game field size can be customized
- Rendering scale can be customized

## Notes

- I did not place every "class" into a single file, although in hindsight this
  might be a good idea and maybe I'll do that at some point ;)
- There are a couple of things I could improve, but right now I'm to lazy;
  for future reference:
  
  - Extract font definitions into customizeable variables
  - Extract the messages into customizeable variables
  - Clean up duplicated code in IndvadersCanvasView
