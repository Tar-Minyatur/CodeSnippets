CodeSnippets
============

Just a collection of some source code snippets that might be useful to somebody at some point. They accumulated on my
harddrive over time and I finally managed to get them a little bit organised so that I (and maybe others) can find them.

You can freely use anything you find here even without mentioning me. Feel free to do whatever you want with my code. 
Just keep in mind that I will not offer any support for it. You use it at your own risk.
